This is the Major League website – a website for students of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile passionate about football to engage with the initiative Major League; here you can find information about the school teams, brackets, players, and about the initiative itself.

The website is developed using modern web technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience across devices.

The website is developed with three clear focuses:
1. **Accessible User Experience**: Ensuring that all users, regardless of their abilities, can easily navigate and interact with the website.
2. **Performance**: Optimizing loading times and responsiveness to provide a seamless experience.
3. **Mobile-First**: Designing the website with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a smooth experience on smaller screens before adapting to larger devices.

Our developers will always check our style variables (app/styles/variables.css) to maintain consistency across the website. And they will use reusable components and design patterns to streamline development and ensure a cohesive look and feel.
